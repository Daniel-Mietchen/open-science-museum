### Data museums
* Basic idea in [Content Curation for Research: A Framework for Building a “Data Museum”](https://doi.org/10.2218/ijdc.v10i2.355)
* I have reserved http://data-museum.org/ .
* Examples of initiatives using the term "data museum":
  - https://www.kansascityed.org/research/cadre/dataservices/datamuseum 
  - http://datamuseum.dk/ &mdash; Dansk Datahistorisk Forening (DDHF)
    - they've done a [market analysis](http://datamuseum.dk/foreningen/dansk-datamuseum/), which projected losses for their envisioned Danish Computer History Museum
    - they also have a [wiki](http://datamuseum.dk/wiki/Forside)
